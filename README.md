## How to install c++ compiler

Since I am using linux pop os, it came with g++ and c++ commands so i did not have
to install it but in case you don't have it installed on your pc type the
following.

- For Debian/Ubuntu
```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install g++
```

- For Fedora
```bash
sudo dnf update
sudo dnf install gcc-c++
```


### How to compile c++
I am using linux to compile my cpp files so I use g++ or c++
also remember that you can't install the c++ command as mine came 
with it installed so is you computer not have this command use g++
- g++ example
```bash
g++ app.cpp -o app.out
```

- c++ example
```bash
# I am not sure if c++ command is the same as g++ but what i know it
# compiles my code and i did not have to install it as it came pre installed if it does not work for you just use g++

c++ app.cpp -o app.out
```
